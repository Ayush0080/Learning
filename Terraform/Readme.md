    - Configuration Management tools are primarily used to maintain desired configuration of systems (inside servers)
        - Example: ALL servers should have Antivirus installed with version 10.0.2

- Infrastructure Orchestration
    - Infrastructure Orchestration is primarily used to create and manage infrastructure environments.
       - Example: Create 3 Servers with 4 GB RAM, 2 vCPUs. Each server should have firewall rule to allow SSH connection from Office IPs.
